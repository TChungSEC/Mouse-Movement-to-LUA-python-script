This is a very simple script that converts mouse movement into LUA code. 

Made specifically for use with Logitech GHUB to create custom recoil scripts for FPS games. 

To use, simply run the script and press the record button (default F2) to start and stop the recording. 

The LUA script will be output as "mouse_movements.lua"
