This is a very simple script that converts mouse movement into LUA code. 


Made specifically for use with Logitech GHUB to create custom recoil scripts for FPS games. 

To use, simply run the script and press the record button (default F2) to start and stop the recording. The default record button can easily be changed. 

The LUA script will be output as "mouse_movements.lua", "mouse_movements1.lua", "mouse_movements2.lua", etc in increasing sequential order.

The LUA file will save to the same directory as the script, so I recommend placing the script in a new folder.
